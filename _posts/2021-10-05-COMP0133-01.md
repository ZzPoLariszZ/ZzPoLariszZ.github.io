### Distributed Systems

Disadvantages of Centralized System

- Single point of failure

- Finite resource \\( \implies \\) Overload

**One Reason for Distributed System: <span style="color:Red">Avaliability</span>**

Method: <span style="color:Red">Replicate</span> data on several servers

Aims:

- Reachability: increasing possibility to access one usable server 

    independent probabilities of a single failure
    
Problems:

- Consistency? - What if servers have different data, client should choose which one to trust?

- Latency? - What if replicas are made far apart? (long round trip time \\( \implies \\) poor user experience)

- Partition Resilience? - What if one seat remain on plane is bought twice due to partition?

*Trade-off between Availability and Consistency*

**Another reason for Distributed System: <span style="color:Red">Scalable Capacity</span>**

Method: <span style="color:Red">Spread</span> users across several servers

Aims:

- Linear Scaling: \\( U \\) users per box \\( \implies \\) \\( N \\) boxes support \\( NU \\) users

Problems:

- Bottlenecks? What if all users' inbox are set on one server?

- Scaling? How to close to linear?

- Load Balance? What if some users get more emails than others?

***Hard to Design Distributed Systems***

- Failure: Hosts, Network ... (which one fails?)

- Heterogeneity 多相性: Different data representations (Big Endian or Little Endian)

- Need consistency (specific definitions for different applications)

- Need concurrency for preformance (waiting synchronously \\( \implies \\) resource idle)

### Security

Before Internet

- Encryption and Authentication using cryptography

- Communication between parties known each other

Internet Era

- Potential attackers all over the Internet

- Parties have no prior relationship

- Cryptography will not enough to solve all problems (e.g., software vulnerabilities...)
