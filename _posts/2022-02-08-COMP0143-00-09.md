Alice sends a message to Bob. Bob cannot know who Alice is.

**Receiver Anonymity**

Alice can send a message to Bob, but cannot find out who Bob is.

Relationship-Level: One message sent by Alice and received by Bob, where Alice and Bob cannot be linked.

**Pseudonymity**

All actions can be linkable to a pseudonym but be unlinkable to a principal.
