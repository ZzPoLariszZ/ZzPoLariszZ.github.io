### Type of Anonymity

**Sender Anonymity**

Alice sends a message to Bob. Bob cannot know who Alice is.

**Receiver Anonymity**

Alice can send a message to Bob, but cannot find out who Bob is.

**Bi-directional Anonymity**

Alice and Bob can talk to each other, but neither of them know the identity of the other.

**Third Party Anonymity**

Alice and Bob converse and know each other, but third party cannot find this out.

---
### Properties of Anonymity

**Unobservability**

Alice and Bob communicate, but no one can tell if they are transmitting or receiving messages.

**Unlinkability**

Message-Level: Two messages sent (received) by Alice (Bob) cannot be linked to the same sender (receiver).

Relationship-Level: One message sent by Alice and received by Bob, where Alice and Bob cannot be linked.

**Pseudonymity**

All actions can be linkable to a pseudonym but be unlinkable to a principal.

### High-latency Anonymity Systems

#### Anonymity Provided by Broadcast

**Process**

One sender can broadcast encrypted messages to many receivers (1-to-N)  
such that only the receivers who can decrypt will get the message  
but others cannot know which receivers can decrypt.

**Pros**

- *Simple* (can be done by trees, rings, buses, etc.)

- *Receiver Anonymity*

**Cons**

- *Coordination ?*

	It is hard for the sender to know all the possible receivers.

- *Sender Anonymity ?*

	All receivers can know the sender.

- *Efficiency ?*

	Problems in latency (when all receivers receive) and bandwidth (need broadcast)  
    especially in a large system (utility will be quite low).

#### Anonymity Provided by Mix

**Process**

1. Multiple senders send messages to a Mix. For example,

	$$
    \text{Alice} \rightarrow \text{Mix}: \{\ \text{Bob}, \, \text{Msg} \ \}_{pk_{\text{Mix}}}
    $$

	where the destination and message are encrypted by public key \\(pk\\) of the Mix.

2. The Mix decrypt to get the destination and message by its private key \\(sk\\)

3. The Mix send the message to the destination. For example,

	$$
    \text{Mix} \rightarrow \text{Bob}: \text{Msg}
    $$

**Mix Requirements**

- Public Key Encryption

- Enough Honest Mix Participants

    Can be more secure if there are more honest Mix participants in one round.

- Bitwise Unlinkability

    Cannot link the corresponding input and output messages of the Mix by bit pattern.

- Traffic Analysis Resistance

    Cannot link the corresponding inputs and outputs of the Mix by metadata (e.g., address, time, size, etc.).

**Pros**

- *Sender Anonymity*

- *Relationship-Level Unlinkability* 

    Cannot link the corresponding input and output messages (sender and receiver)

**Cons**

- *High costs* for all requirements

- *Mix itself can be untrusted*

- *Other Mix participants can be untrusted*
