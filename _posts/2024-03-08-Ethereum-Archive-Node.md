<!--more-->

---
### System Information

---
### Step 1 - Rust Installation

1. Install **Rust** using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

    ```
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

    During installation, enter 1 for the default installation when prompted

2. Check **Cargo** version after **Rust** installation completes:

    ```
    source $HOME/.cargo/env
    cargo version
    ```

    which is `cargo 1.76.0 (c84b36747 2024-01-18)`

---
### Step 2 - Reth Installation (Build from Source)

Ref: [GitHub](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth) & [Docs](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/)

1. Dependencies:
   
   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install libclang-dev pkg-config build-essential
   ```

2. Build **Reth**:
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth
   cd reth
   ```

   ```
   cargo install --locked --path bin/reth --bin reth
   ```

3. Check **Reth** version after installation completes:

    ```
    reth --version
    ```

    which is `reth Version: 0.2.0-beta.1`

---
### Step 3 - Lighthouse Installation (Build from Source)

Ref: [GitHub](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse) & [Docs](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/)

1. Dependencies:
   
   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y git gcc g++ make cmake pkg-config llvm-dev libclang-dev clang
   ```

2. Build **Lighthouse**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse.git
    cd lighthouse
    ```

    ```
    git checkout stable
    make
    ```

3. Check **Lighthouse** version after installation completes:

    ```
    lighthouse --version
    ```

    which is `Lighthouse v5.0.0-b5bae6e`

---
### Step 4 - Run Ethereum Archive Node on Mainnet

1. Run **Reth** Execution Client

    ```
    RUST_LOG=info reth node
    ```

    > If you want to enable all JSON-RPC namespaces on the HTTP server, you can add:
    > ```
    > --http --http.api all
    > ```
    > then, you can use `localhost:8545` to interact with Reth Execution Node over JSON-RPC

    > If you want to view metrics of Reth Execution Node, you can add:
    > ```
    > --metrics localhost:9001
    > ```
    > then, you can use **Prometheus** to collect metrics off of the endpoint  
    > and use **Grafana** to scrape the metrics from Prometheus and define a dashboard to visualize them  
    > Detailed instructions can be found in [Metrics](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/run/observability.html) Page

2. Run **Lighthouse** Consensus Client

    ```
    RUST_LOG=info lighthouse bn \
    --network mainnet \
    --execution-endpoint http://localhost:8551 \
    --execution-jwt /home/<UserName>/.local/share/reth/mainnet/jwt.hex \
    --checkpoint-sync-url https://mainnet.checkpoint.sigp.io
    ```

    You MUST use the same JWT secret in BOTH Reth Execution Client and Lighthouse Consensus Client,  
    where `/home/<UserName>/.local/share/reth/mainnet/jwt.hex` is the default JWT secret generated by Reth

    > If you do not want to become validators on your node, you can add:  
    > ```
    > --disable-deposit-contract-sync
    > ```
    > which will disable the syncing of deposit logs from the execution node


Note that the beta version of Reth has some issues: it might be stuck or killed (i.e., OOM) unexpectedly during syncing

Please re-execute Step 4 to restart both Reth Execution Client and Lighthouse Consensus Client when issues happen

You should also use `htop` to monitor CPU and Memory usage (and `smartctl` to monitor SSD health information)

---
### Step 5 - Test JSON-RPC APIs

After the syncing completes, you can use the following command in Terminal:

```
curl localhost:8545 \ 
-X POST \ 
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \ 
--data '{"method":"eth_chainId","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
```

The response should be

```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"0x1","id":1}
```
