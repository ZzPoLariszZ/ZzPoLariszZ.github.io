### Network-based vs. Host-based

#### Network-based

**Pros**

- Can see lots of traffic at one monitoring point

- Can filter traffic for many vulnerable hosts

**Cons**

- Limited information available: only packet fields, payload contents

#### Host-based

**Pros**

- More information available: see effect of network request on running processâ€™s execution

- Potentially more accurate

**Cons**

- Requires changes to host software

- Performance concern (not slow down)

---
### Design Goals

- Work on executables (no source code required)

- Prevent <span style="color:Red">broadest possible range of exploits</span>

- Low/No false positives and false negatives

- Minimal performance reduction

---
### W \\( \oplus \\) X Page Protections

#### Background

CPU implements page protection in hardware

For each 4K memory page, permission bits specified in page table entry in kernel: read, write

<span style="color:Red">If the page can be read (or read and write), it can be executable implicitly</span>

#### Problem

- Code supplied by user in input data

- Execution transferred to user input data

**<span style="color:Red">User-influenced Data and Control Data are mixed</span>**

#### Idea

**<span style="color:Red">Not let CPU execute instructions stored in data pages</span>**

**<span style="color:Red">such that each page should either be writable or executable but NOT BOTH: W \\( \oplus \\) X</span>**

- Text Pages: X not W

- Data Pages: W not X (e.g., stack, heap)

#### Implementations

AMD and Intel introduced "NX" bit (no execute)

Linux PaX implements W \\( \oplus \\) X for x86 processors without NX bit hardware

- Based on segment limit registers

- Halve address space available to each process

- Minor performance reduction

#### Limitations

**Break JIT**

W \\( \oplus \\) X Page Protection **<span style="color:Red">break just-in-time (JIT) code generation</span>** in legacy applications

JIT:  
Applications generate codes while running,  
and then jump into the generated code (e.g., run-time type checking in JavaScript)

**The return-to-libc Attack**

Instead of putting shellcode on stack but put arguments of function in libc there

then **<span style="color:Red">overwrite return address with pointer to that function</span>**

e.g., `system("/bin/sh");` 

such that the buffer overflow attacks overwrite the return address by the address of `system` in text segment

and the only argument is stored on stack as part of user input

---
### Address Space Layout Randomization

#### Background

To operate the **return-to-libc** attacks, **<span style="color:Red">attacker must know, predict, or guess the exact address</span>**

including shellcode buffer address, libc function address, string argument address, etc.

#### Idea

**<span style="color:Red">Randomize addresses in process</span>** to let attackers guess wrong address with high probability such that

- **Jump to unmapped memory: crash**

- **Jump to invalid instruction stream: crash**

**<span style="color:Red">Useful as efficient exploit detector (memory faults or illegal instructions suggest exploit)</span>**

#### Implementations

**x86-32**

Linux process contains three memory regions

- Executable: text, init data, uninit data

- Mapped: heap, dynamic (shared) libraries, thread stacks, shared memory

- Stack: user stack

<span style="color:Red">ASLR adds random offset to each region when process created (with 16, 16, 24 bits randomness)</span>

<span style="color:Red">This is easy to be supported by virtual memory hardware</span>

#### Limitations

**x86-32: Random Offset to Mapped Region is Limited to 16 Bits**

- highest 4 bits (28-31) cannot be changed; otherwise, it would interfere with big `mmap()`s

- lowest 12 bits (00-11) cannot be changed; otherwise, it make `mmap()`ed pages not be page-aligned (should be in 4K boundary)

**x86-32: Derandomization Attacks**

<span style="color:Red">Limitation of 16 bits random offset</span> is easy to guess by <span style="color:Red">brute force attacks in mapped region</span>

After the random offset is known, the exact address can be predicted such that <span style="color:Red">return-to-libc attacks</span> will work again

- Should know the base of mapped region without random offset (by `objdump` tools)

- Try to return to `usleep()`, guessing random offset for mapped region each time

    the `usleep()` argument is selected to 0x01010101 (16 seconds) that is long enought to observe

- If guess ***wrong***, target process crashes, the kernel closes connection ***immediately***; 

    <span style="color:Red">The parent process creates new child with same random offset as previous died child using `fork()`</span>
    
    <span style="color:Red">In Unix, the contents of memory are copied from parent process to child process</span>
    
    <span style="color:Red">and some of them include pointers will not be valid (not point to the right place) if addresses are changed</span>

- If guess ***right***, target process ***delays*** in `usleep()`, then crashes and closes connection immediately

- After the right guess, compute the exact address of target address to perform return-to-libc attacks

Details of attack is illustrated in Section 2.2.2 in paper *On the Effectiveness of Address-Space Randomization*

**x86-64: Derandomization Attacks**

<span style="color:Red">The random offsets will be increased to about 40 bits</span>

<span style="color:Red">to make brute force attack much harder without attracting attention</span>

**Performance of Derandomization Attacks**

The performance in x86-32 is shown in Section 2.2.3 in paper *On the Effectiveness of Address-Space Randomization*

- For single randomization at startup, the expected number of probes is \\( 2^{n-1} \\)

- For n-bit full randomization (parent and child) after every crash, the expected number of probes is \\( 2^n \\) (only twice)

The analysis is in Section 3.2 in paper *On the Effectiveness of Address-Space Randomization*

### Taint Check

#### Approach

Instrument program to **<span style="color:Red">monitor its own execution</span>** and detect when exploit occurs

#### Goal

- Work on binaries (no source code required)

- Low false positives and false negatives

- Detect wide range of exploits (<span style="color:Red">new varieties all the time & point solutions unconvincing</span>)

- Help humans <span style="color:Red">understand how exploit worked after the exploit</span>

#### Idea

Many exploits use data supplied by user (or derived from data supplied by user) 

to **<span style="color:Red">subvert control flow of program</span>** (e.g., modify jump, call instruction target addresses, or function return addresses)

During execution, before any control transfer instruction, **<span style="color:Red">validate target address</span>** not derived from user-supplied data

- If it is, exploit detected and raise alarm

- If it not, continue execution normally

***<span style="color:Red">NOT TRUST user-supplied data by marking them as tainted</span>***

and **<span style="color:Red">propagate taint during execution</span>**

- Results of operations on tainted data should be tainted

- Copies of tainted data should be tainted

- Taint will be cleared when tainted data is overwritten with untainted data

#### Implementations

**Propagatation**

- After **<span style="color:Red">I/O system calls</span>**

    If reading from socket, mark target<span style="color:Red">buffer contents</span> as tainted

- After all **<span style="color:Red">memory load instructions</span>**

    If source memory tainted, mark <span style="color:Red">register</span> tainted

    If source memory untainted, mark <span style="color:Red">register</span> untainted

- After all **<span style="color:Red">memory store instructions</span>**

    If source register tainted, mark <span style="color:Red">memory</span> tainted

    If source register untainted, mark <span style="color:Red">memory</span> untainted

- After all **<span style="color:Red">arithmetic instructions</span>**

    If any operand tainted, mark <span style="color:Red">result</span> tainted

    If no operands tainted, mark <span style="color:Red">result</span> untainted
    
**Detection**

Add the following checking before all **control transfer instructions** (e.g., jump, call, ret, etc.)

- If register or memory location holding target function pointer is tainted, raise alarm

- If not, continue execution normally

**Shadow Memory**

**<span style="color:Red">The taint status (flag) of each byte if memory is tracked by shadow memory</span>**

e.g., `Is-Taint(addr) -> { T | F }` and `Taint(addr, len) or Untaint(addr, len)`

**Operation Mode**

- *Fast*

    single bit for taint flag of each byte of memory
    
    (if single bit  taint flag of each bit of memory will be much faster without packing bits to byte)
    
- *Detailed*

    four-byte pointer to taint data structure (including details of system call, stack, value)
    
    written at time of tainting and useful for exploit analysis
    
#### Expansions

can successfully detects many overwrite exploits (targeting at return address, function pointer, format string, GOT)

since it can also instrument function and system calls

#### Limitations

**Greatly affect performance**

When executing with a single request which returns small data (i.e., 1 KB), 
    
the overhead will be <span style="color:Red">multiple times (i.e., 25 times)</span> than CGI without Valgrind (as baseline)
    
but the overhead of CGI (asking dynamic script on the server) is already very high due to invokings and interpreters
    
Moreover, the evaluation time might not be a right metric where throughput is better (can use concurrent requests)

**Implicit Flows**

suppose `x` is tainted: 

``` c
if (x = 0) 
    y = 0; 
else 
    y = 1;
```

such that `y` is set by a constant that is directly influenced by `x` (and `y` will influence other values)
    
However, taint propagatation not include condition flags (possible false negatives)
    
If including condition flags, it will results in inappropriate propagation of taint (possible false positives)

#### Applications

**Identify worm payloads**

Can be configured to store trace of tainted data flow from all inputs

When exploit detected, can walk back to <span style="color:Red">identify input that led to exploit</span>

Could pass worm payloads to signature generation system, like Autograph
    
which is Much more accurate than port-scanner heuristic

**Prevent exploit of server**

Halt execution upon exploit detection
    
but due to high overhead, it is too slow for production servers
    
Moreover, 
    
adversary may possibly be able to   
<span style="color:Red">detect monitored servers by their slow response time and avoid sending them exploit payload</span>
    
Therefore, it might be useful to deploy on a few servers which <span style="color:Red">use sample traffic as input</span>
