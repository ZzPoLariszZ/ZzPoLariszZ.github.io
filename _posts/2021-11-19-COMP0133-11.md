LEC-11: Introduction to Security

### Perfect Security: An Unattainable Goal

Security is

- A question of how <span style="color:Red">motivated</span> adversary is, and how much  <span style="color:Red">money</span> he has

- No individual technique perfect

    e.g., <span style="color:Red">People</span> can be a serious problem in each real-world system

- Could meet a stated goal, but the goal could be  <span style="color:Red">inappropriate</span>

***<span style="color:Red">Weakest item will determine the system security</span>***

---
### Definitions

- **Security**

    techniques to controal who can access/modify systems

- **Principal**

    unit of accountability in a system (e.g., users)

- **Access Control**

    technqiues to restrict operations to particular principals
    
    (e.g., authentication, authorization ...)

- **Authentication**

    verification of identity of principal making request

- **Authorization**

    granting of request to principal

---
### Attacks

- **Violation of Confidentiality**

    Confidentiality: attackers <span style="color:Red">read data without authorization</span>

- **Vilation of Integrity**

    Integrity: attackers <span style="color:Red">modify data without authorization</span>

- **Vilation of Availability** (Denial of service)

    Availability: attackers <span style="color:Red">make system unavaliable to legitimate users</span>

---
### General Approach

Figure out what to protect & what it is worth (**Asset**)

Figure out which attacks you want to defend against (**Threat Model**)

State **goals** and desired **properties** clearly (specifically)

e.g., Attack \\( X \\) on resource \\( Y \\) should cost \\( Z \\)
    
Structure with two types of components

- Trusted: must operate as designer expected, or breach (minimize this components)

- Untrusted: subverted operation does not lead to breach 
    
Analyze resulting system (self-testing and testing by expected team), monitor success

---
### Policy

**<span style="color:Red">Security is a Negative Goal</span>**

Ensure that nothing happens without authorization (hard to control something not do)

First step: specify who authorized to do what by ***policy***

**Definition**: Goal that security must achieve

- Human Intent: originates from outside system

**Concepts**

- Subject: principal

- Object: abstraction to which access requested (e.g., file, memory page, serial port)

    Each object supports different kinds of access (e.g., read or write file, change permissions, …)

**Access control**

determine that which operation should be allowed

- What principal making request? (Authentication)

- Is operation permitted to principal? (Authorization)

---
### Local User Authentication

#### Goal

Only the owner of the file can access it

#### UNIX Authentication Policy

- Each file has an owner principal: an integer user ID

- Each file has associated owner permissions (read, write, execute, &c.)

- Each process runs with integer user ID

    only can access file as owner if matches file’s owner user ID

- OS assigns user ID to user’s shell process at login time, authenticated by username and password

    <username, user id, password>

- Shell process creates new child processes with same user ID when typing commands

#### Bad Approach: Plaintext Password Database

Keep password database in a file 

Passwords stored in file in plaintext

**Protection**

Make file readable only by privileged superuser (root)

`/bin/login` program prompts for usernames and passwords on console

runs as root, so can read password database

**Attacks**

- Shut down the computer, pull out the disk, read the disk in some other computer as root

- If attackers can play a role as root, they can attack successfully

#### Better Approach: Hashed Password Database

**Hash Function**

\\( H \\) is a cryptographic hash function \\( H(x) = y \\) where

- *Preimage-Resistant*

    Given \\( y \\) and \\( H() \\), it is computationally infeasible to recover \\( x \\)
    
- *Second-Preimage-Resistant*

    Given \\( y \\), it is computationally infeasible to find \\( x' \neq x \\) such that \\( H(x) = H(x') = y \\)

**Idea**

Instead of password in plaintext, store the hashed password \\( H(password) \\)

Make file readable by anyone (since hash functions cannot be inverted)

**Dictionary Attack**

1. Obtain copy of password file (until recently, world-readable on UNIX)

2. Compute hash results for all possible common word ----- *only done once and work for all*

3. String compare resulting hashed words against passwords in file

#### Improved Approach: Salted & Hashed Password Database

Generate a random string of bytes \\( r \\) ----- Salt

Store the pair \\( (H(password,r), r) \\) in password file

**Benefits**

- Same password produces different result on every machine

- Must see password file before can hash dictionary

- Single hashed dictionary not work for multiple hosts

**Application**

In Modern UNIX: 

- Use salted & hashed password database

- The database is readable only by root

However, dictionary attacks are still possible after seeing password file

### Remote User Authentication

#### Requirements

**Confidentiality**

- <span style="color:Red">defend eavesdropping</span>

- transfering username and plaintext password is not accepted

**Integrity**

- <span style="color:Red">defend inserting, deleting, modifying, and replaying</span>

- transfering username and hased password is not accepted (attack by recording and replaying)

such that 

- message must change unpredictably at each login

- message must be verifiable at server as matching the user-known secret value
    
#### Possible Approach (only use Hash Functions)

**Steps**

1. Store the following information in server password database:
    
    \\( Alice:99:H^{99}(password) \\)
    
    The number is announced by server to client
    
2. At first login, Alice sends:

    \\( \{Alice, H^{98}(password)\} \\)

3. After verifying and logging, server then updates its database to contain:

    \\( Alice:98:H^{98}(password) \\)

4. At next login, Alice sends:

    \\( \{Alice, H^{97}(password)\} \\)
    
5. and so on ......

**Limitations**

- Alice must store her secret on the server securely (best if physically at server’s console)

- Alice must choose *total number* of logins at time of storing secret

- When logins all “used”, must store new secret on server securely again

#### Common Approach (use Encryption)
