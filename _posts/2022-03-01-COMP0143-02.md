### Bitcoin V.S. Ethereum

All known cryptocurrency systems define currency units to realize an incentive system  

however, dose not provide them a legal status of any form

Here give **<span style="color:Red">Bitcoin</span>** and **<span style="color:Red">Ethereum</span>** as examples  

who are representatives of different design philosophies

|Bitcoin | Ethereum|
|--|--|
|UTXO (***<span style="color:Red">Unspent Transaction Output</span>***) Model | Account Model|
|transactions transfer ownership of coins | transactions update account balances|
|Stateless: traced from all UTXOs | Stateful: update continuously|
|Requires change | Requires No change|
|Value computed from <br> traceability of every unit <br> to its coinbase transaction | Value computed from <br> the validity of all state transitions|
|Not fungible | Fungible|

### Bitcoin's Transaction Layer

#### Address

The hash of the public key \\(pk\\) from an ECDSA key pair \\((pk,sk)\\)

Regular Bitcoin addresses always start with 1

#### Transaction

|Inputs| Outputs|
|--|--|
|`ptx` <br> Hash of a previous transaction| `val` <br> Number of Satoshi <br> this output is worth when claimed|
|`idx` <br> Specific output in the referenced transaction| `scr`: <br> Second half of a *script* <br> which specifies receiver and other things|
|`sig` <br> First half of a *script* <br> which includes a signature|

**Properties**

- The referenced transactions must be UTXOs

- UTXOs can only be spent in their entirety

- Change is refunded via output addresses

#### Double Spending

**Problem**

Since Bitcoin transactions are digital objects,  

it is possible to be used multiple times (unlike physical coins)

**Solution**

Decentralized Bookkeeping: Distributed Ledger Technique (DLT, Blockchain)

#### Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)

Blockchain is a linked list of blocks with hash pointers linked with each other (append-only)

Each block has a header (metadata) and payload (transactions)

**Block Structure**

|Size| Field| Description|
|--|--|--|
|4| Magic number| Fixed network identifier 0xD9B4BEF9|
|4| Block size| Number of bytes to end of block|
|4| Version| Block version number|
|32| Previous Block Hash| Hash of the previous block header|
|32| Merkle Root| Merkle root hash of all transactions|
|4 | Time| Block timestamp in seconds|
|4 | Target| Number of leading zeroes in block hash (difficulty)|
|4 | Nonce |Proof-of-work mining counter|
|1-9| Transaction counter| Number of included transactions|
|Variable| Transactions| List of transactions|

#### Simplified Payment Verification (SPV)

Method that not need to store all blocks in the blockchain

- Store only block headers which are on the order of tens of megabytes

- Enables them to selectively verify transactions but not the entire blockchain

- Trust that miners do not include bad transactions or that full nodes watch out for this

- Often used in resource-constraint environments, e.g. mobile wallets

#### Block Rewards

- The first transaction of every block, the so-called ***coinbase transaction***, 
    
    assigns a block reward and the sum of all fees to the consensus leader (e.g., a miner)

- These coinbase transactions do not have any other inputs or signatures

- Outputs of coinbase transactions can only be spent after 100 blocks (cooldown)

- These block rewards provide incentives for consensus nodes (e.g., miners) 
    
    to invest their computational resources and keep the system up and running
    
#### Bitcoin's Scripting Language

[Bitcoin Script Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script)

**Features**

- Stack-based, stateless

- Intentionally not Turing complete, no loops

- Support for cryptography

- Time / memory usage bound by program size

- Commands are specified as opcodes

**Types**

*Pay-To-PubKeyHash (P2PKH)*

- Allows to send transactions to public key hashes (addresses starting with 1)

- Basic Bitcoin transaction form

*Pay-To-Script-Hash (P2SH)*

- Allows to send transactions to script hashes (addresses starting with 3)

- To spend bitcoins sent via P2SH, 

	recipient must provide a redeem script matching the script hash

- Enables richer functionality than P2PKH (e.g. multi-signatures)

### Ethereumâ€™s Transaction Layer

**Key Feature**: The ***<span style="color:Red">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</span>***  
can execute Turing-complete scripts and run decentralized applications

#### Account Types

**Externally Owned Account (EOA)**

- Controlled by a signing key

- Can be created for free

- Can initiate transactions

**Code Account (CA)**

- Controlled by program logic

- Creation produces cost because it requires network storage

- Can only send transactions (message calls) in response to receiving transactions.

- Transactions from an EOA to a CA can trigger code 

	which can execute many different actions, 

	such as transferring tokens or even creating a new contract

#### Account Structure

The account address with account state

Account state have four fields

|Field|Description|
|--|--|
|`nonce`|Number of transactions sent from the account <br> which ensures that transactions are only processed once|
|`balance`|Amount of *wei* owned by the account|
|`codeHash`|Hash of the code that is stored in the state database for CAs <br> Empty for EOAs|
|`storageRoot`|Root hash of a Merkle Patricia tree <br> that encodes the storage contents of the account|

#### Transaction Structure

|Field|Description|
|--|--|
|Nonce|Sequence number set by the originating EOA <br> used to prevent message replay
|Gas price| Price of gas (in wei) the originator is willing to pay
|Gas limit| Maximum amount of gas the originator is willing to pay
|Recipient| Destination Ethereum address
|Value| Amount of ether to send to the destination
|Data| Variable-length binary data payload
|(v; r ; s)| ECDSA signature components of the origination EOA

#### Transaction Fees

**Goals**

- Compensation for provisioning of computational resources

- Prevent abuse of Ethereum's Turing-complete execution environment

**Concepts**

- Every instruction has a gas price

- Exchange rate between gas and ether is market-determined:

    $$ \textit{fee} = \textit{consumed_gas} \times \textit{gas_price} $$

- If a computation needs more gas than provided by the user, 

    the corresponding transaction is rolled back and the miner gets the fee

#### Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

- Quasi-Turing-complete

- Stack-based

- 256-bit words

- State transitions can be specified (almost) arbitrarily

- Low-level programming language: EVM byte code

- High-level programming languages: **<span style="color:Red">Solidity</span>**, LLL, Serpent, Vyper

#### Other Important Concepts

**Swarm**

- Distributed database that stores arbitrary information

- Unlike on a blockchain there are no serialization and validity checks

- Hash-based addressing

- Ether-based incentive system

**Ethereum Name Service (ENS)**

- Distributed database that maps human-readable strings to Ethereum addresses

- Ether-based incentive system

**Oracles**

- Services that push details on real-world events onto the blockchain 

    to make them available to code accounts.

- Hard to decentralize, trust in a few responsible parties necessary.
