UCL Course COMP0133 LEC-16: Software Vulnerabilities and Exploits

<!--more-->

---
### Software is Imperfect

Programs are complex, and **often include subtle bugs unforeseen by the programmer**

It is fundamentally hard to prevent all programmer errors

- Design itself may use flawed logic

- Even if logic correct, implementation may vary from programmer intent

#### Advanced Programming Languages

**C and C++ particularly dangerous**

- Allow arbitrary manipulation of pointers

- Require programmer-directed allocation and freeing of memory

- Don’t provide <span style="color:Red">memory safety; very difficult to reason about which portions of memory a line of C changes</span>

- Offer high performance, so extremely prevalent, especially in network servers and OSes

**Java offers memory safety, but not a panacea**

since JRE written in (many thousands of lines of) C

#### Vulnerabilities and Exploits

**Vulnerability**

input-dependent bug that can cause program to complete operations that deviate from programmer’s intent

**Exploit**

input that, when presented to program, triggers a particular vulnerability

***<span style="color:Red">Attacker can use exploit to execute operations without authorization on vulnerable host</span>***

Vulnerable program executes with some privilege level

- Many network servers execute as superuser

- Users run applications with their own user ID

- Result: great opportunity for exploits to do harm

### Prerequisites

#### Virtual Memory Map of a UNIX Process

- **Text**

    executable instructions, read-only data (size fixed at compile time)

- **Data**

    initialized and uninitialized data (<span style="color:Red">grows towards higher addresses</span>)

- **Stack** 

    function arguments and local variables (<span style="color:Red">grows toward lower addresses & Last-In-First-Out</span>)

#### Stack Frame

Stack Frame is the region of stack used within C function

- *Stack Pointer*

    %esp (always points to the top of stack by default)

- *Frame Pointer*

    %ebp (points to the base of the frame of the current function)
    
#### Function Process

- To **call** function `f()`, allocate new stack frame

    1. Push arguments, e.g., `f(a, b, c)` (<span style="color:Red">in reversed order</span>)

    2. Push `return address: next instruction (%eip)` in caller

    3. Set `%eip = address of f();` jump to callee

    4. Push saved frame pointer where `%ebp is caller’s stack frame`

    5. Set `%ebp = %esp` to set frame pointer to start of new frame

    6. Set `%esp -= sizeof(locals);` to allocate local variables

- To **return** from `f()`, deallocate stack frame

    1. Set `%esp += sizeof(locals);` to deallocates local variables

    2. Set `%ebp = saved frame pointer from stack` such that it changes to caller’s stack frame

    3. Set `%eip = saved return address from stack` such that it returns to next instruction in caller

### Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities and Stack Smashing Exploits

#### Buffer Overflow

- Buffers in C manipulated using **pointers**

- C allows **<span style="color:Red">arbitrary arithmetic on pointers</span>**
    
    - Compiler has **<span style="color:Red">no notion of size of object pointed to</span>**

    - So programmers must **explicitly check in code** that pointer remains within intended object

    - But programmers often do not do so; vulnerability!

- Buffer overflows used in many exploits

    e.g.,

    1. Input long data that runs past end of programmer’s buffer, over memory that guides program control flow

    2. Enclose code you want executed within data

    3. Overwrite control flow info with address of your code
    
#### Stack Smashing

**Reason**

<span style="color:Red">User-influenced Data is stored together with Control Data in stack</span>

The return address stored on stack directly influences program control flow

and local variables allocated before return address in stack frame

if programmer allocates buffer as local on stack, reads input, and writes it into buffer without checking input fits in buffer:

- send input containing shellcode you wish to run

- write past end of buffer, and **<span style="color:Red">overwrite return address with address of malicious code within stack buffer</span>**

- when function returns, the malicious code executes
    
**Design Principle**
    
There are some *difficulties* for attackers

- <span style="color:Red">existence of stack-allocated buffer</span> without bounds check in program (easy for open-source code)

- <span style="color:Red">exact address</span> for start of stack-allocated buffer (address changes)

- <span style="color:Red">exact offset</span> of return address beyond buffer start (buffer size without source code)

However, attackers do not know these exact values

*For exact address*

- Attackers can **<span style="color:Red">precede shellcode with `NOP` slide</span>** (long sequence of NOPs or equivalent instructions)

- If programe jumps into `NOP` slide (`NOP` will be ignored), shellcode executes

*For exact offset*

- Attackers can **<span style="color:Red">repeat shellcode’s address many times in input</span>**

- if first instance occurs before return address’s location on stack, 

    and return address will be overwritten by one instance with enough repeats
    
**Practical Shellcode**

Shellcode usually executes command `/bin/sh` which gives attacker a shell on exploited machine

``` c
// shellcode.c
void main()
{
    char *name[2];
    name[0] = "/bin/sh";
    name[1] = NULL;
    execve(name[0], name, NULL);
    exit(0);                     // if execve fail, not cause core dump
}
```

It is easy to compile and disassemble `shellcode.c` to get HEX representaton of instructions (e.g., by gdb)

However, the exact address of string `"/bin/sh"` (first argument of `execve`) is needed to execute `execve`

**<span style="color:Red">Attackers can use `jmp` and `call` instruction which allow %eip-relative addressing (offset from current %eip)</span>**

*Use relative offset addressing*

- add `call` instruction at end of shellcode, with target of first shellcode instruction, using relative addressing

- place `"/bin/sh"` immediately after call instruction

- precede first shellcode instruction with `jmp` to `call`, using relative addressing

- call will push next instruction’s address onto stack

- after call, stack will contain address of `"/bin/sh"`

*Use label (easier way)*

**C marks end of string with NULL byte (e.g., `strcpy()` will stop copying if they encounter NULL byte in shellcode instructions)**

**<span style="color:Red">Attackers can replace instructions containing NULL bytes with equivalent instructions that not contain NULL bytes in HEX encodings</span>**

#### Mitigation

- Always explicitly check input length against target buffer size

- Avoid C library calls that not do length checking

    e.g., `sprintf(buf, …)`, `scanf(“%s”, buf)`, `strcpy(buf, input)`

- But use safer versions

    e.g., `snprintf(buf, buflen, …)`, `scanf(“%256s”, buf)`, `strncpy(buf, input, 256)`

### Format String Vulnerabilities and Exploits

#### Format String Vulnerabilities

There are `printf`-like functions in C

- `printf(char *fmtstr, arg1, arg2, …);` e.g., `printf(“%d %d”, 17, 42);`

- where the first argument, format string `fmtstr`, specifies number and type of further arguments

If programmer **<span style="color:Red">allows input to be used as format string</span>**, 
    
attacker can force `printf`-like function to **<span style="color:Red">overwrite arbitrary memory (e.g., return address, privilege flag, Global Offset Table, etc)</span>**

#### Format String Exploits

**Use `%n` to Overwrite Memory**

`%n` format string specifier directs `printf` to write 

<span style="color:Red">the number of bytes written before this specifier</span>

into the integer pointed to by the matching `int*` argument 

``` c
int i;
printf("foobar%n\n", (int *) &i);  // output: foobar
printf("i = %d\n", i);             // output: i = 6 (foobar has six bytes: f, o, o, b, a, r)
```

Because `printf` increments pointer to point next argument predictively for each string specifier in `fmtstr`

such that attackers

- <span style="color:Red">supply the target address that attackers want to overwrite at start of `fmtstr`</span>

- <span style="color:Red">add string specifiers in `fmtstr` to increment pointer so it points to target address that attackers want to overwrite</span>

- <span style="color:Red">supply `%n` string specifier at end of `fmtstr`</span>

**<span style="color:Red">Result: Attackers can overwrite the target address with the number of bytes before `%n`</span>**

**Use `%u` to Control Written Values**

`%u` format string specifier **<span style="color:Red">allows indication of exactly how many characters to output</span>**

e.g., `%20u` means "use 20 digits when printing this unsigned integer" which will cost 20 bytes

#### Practical Format String

**Template**

``` c
[dummy int][4 bytes target address + 0]
[dummy int][4 bytes target address + 1]
[dummy int][4 bytes target address + 2]
[dummy int][4 bytes target address + 2]
[stack pop]
%[control 1st byte value to write]u%n
%[control 2nd byte value to write]u%n
%[control 3rd byte value to write]u%n
%[control 4th byte value to write]u%n
```

**dummy int**

4 non-zero bytes that are used to consume `%u` 

e.g., `\x01\x01\x01\x01`

**target address**

e.g., 

the target address is `0xbfff8218` (based on the little-endian)

- 4 bytes target address + 0 is `\x18\x82\xff\xbf`

- 4 bytes target address + 1 is `\x19\x82\xff\xbf`

- 4 bytes target address + 2 is `\x1a\x82\xff\xbf`

- 4 bytes target address + 3 is `\x1b\x82\xff\xbf`

**stack pop**

A sequence of `%08x` format string specifier to advance `printf()` argument pointer to first byte after stack pop

Each `%08x` shows memory in stack with 8-digit padded hexadecimal numbers, 

and 2-digit padded hexadecimal numbers represents 1 byte, which means each `%08x` represents 4 bytes in memory

e.g., 

when `printf()` begins processing the format string `fmtstr`,

its "next argument to print" pointer points to a memory location 

that is exactly 48 bytes lower in memory than the location of the buffer `fmtstr`

such that the number of `%08x` should be *48 / 4 = 12*

**control value**

Each dummy int costs *4 bytes*

Each target address costs *4 bytes*

Each `%08x` costs *8 bytes* ----- different from it represents in memory

Note that the counter for `%n` is ***<span style="color:Red">cumulative</span>***, and there is an algorithm to calculate next counter

``` c
int compute_padding(int write_byte, int already_written)
{
    write_byte += 0x100;
    already_written %= 0x100;
    
    int padding = (write_byte - already_written) % 0x100;
    if (padding < 10)
        padding += 0x100;
    
    return padding;
}
```

**<span style="color:Red">Attention</span>**

Because each overwritten value in each target address is determined by one `%n` which is an integer, 

and each integer will consume 32 bits (4 bytes) in memory in 32-bit system,

such that ***<span style="color:Red">each overwritten value will fill 4 bytes in memory</span>***

but ***<span style="color:Red">only the value in the least significant byte (in lowest memory address) should be kept</span>***

**Result**

After using *4* `%n` format string specifiers, there will be *4* meaningful bytes in memeory are overwritten (**<span style="color:Red">Write 4 Primitives</span>**)

### Disclosure and Patching of Vulnerabilities

**Software vendors and open-source developers audit code, release vulnerability reports**

- Usually describe vulnerability, but don’t give exploit

- Often include announcement of patch

**Race after disclosure: users patch vs attackers exploit**

- Users are often lazy or unwilling to patch

- Attackers usually have high incentives to find vulnerabilities and design exploits

    - Arbitrary code injection allow:

        1. Defacing of widely viewed web site

        2. Stealing valuable confidential data from server

        3. Destruction of data on server

        4. Recruitment of zombies to botnets (spam, DoS)

    - Market in vulnerabilities and exploits

- "patches" can break software, or include new vulnerabilities



**Disclosure best for users: can patch or disable vs. risk of widest harm by 0-day exploits**

where the undisclosed vulnerabilities called ***0-day Exploits***

***<span style="color:Red">However, preventing all exploits extremely challenging (nearly impossible)</span>***

- Stopping one category leads attackers to use others

- New categories continually arising
