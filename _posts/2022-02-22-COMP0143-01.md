### Network Architecture

#### Classic Client-Server Paradigm

- **Server**
    
    - Provide resources and services (reply)
    
    - Passive (only reply when client requests)
    
- **Client**

    - Request resources and services (only request, not share)
    
    - Active (should have the knowledge about sever)

#### Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Paradigm

- All actors, called ***peers***, are equal

- Can have both server and client capabilities (chosen by themselves)

- Resources and services are shared between peers

**Roles Specific in Bitcoin**

*Regular*

- <u>Create</u> transactions to spend bitcoins
    
- <u>Verify</u> the correctness of received transactions and blocks
    
- <u>Reply</u> valid transactions and blocks
    
*Miner*

- <u>Create, Verify, and Reply</u>
    
- <u>Mine</u> blocks by solving puzzles and win rewards
    
#### Network Taxonomy

- *Reachable Network*: accept public incoming connections

- *Non-reachable Network*: not accept or cannot be reached (hidden behind NAT or blocked by firewall)

- *Extend Network*: use different protocols to communicate (not always P2P)

### Address Propagation

#### Challenges

- How do new peers **find** existing ones in the network? (Are found nodes **trusted**?)

- How do new peers **announce** their presence in the network?

#### Peer Bootstrapping Approaches

- **Internet Relay Chats (IRC) - Deprecated 不赞成的**

    Use IRC channels on [irc.lfnet.org](https://irc.lfnet.org) to bootstrap (bundled with a small IRC client)

    Join a random channel between bitcoin00 and bitcoin99, then connect to other peers (until its peer database full)

    ***Abandoned*** after [irc.lfnet.org](https://irc.lfnet.org) was shutdown

- **<span style="color:Red">Trusted DNS Seed Servers</span>**

    <u>DNS - Domain Name System</u>: Map URLs to IP addresses

    To obtain a list of active peers, 

    the new nodes can first quires serveral well-known DNS Seed Servers

    *Command to query in Unix*

    ```
    dig [DNS URLs]
    ```

- **<span style="color:Red">Hardcoded Trusted Addresses</span>**

    If DNS does not work or you do not trust the listed peers,  
    the new nodes can connect to a hardcoded list of seed servers (as a last resort)

#### Populate in Peer Database

1. New node \\(P\\) obtains a list of peers using previous appraoches

2. \\(P\\) establishes some *outgoing* connections to a subset of these peers (by default 8)

3. \\(P\\) tries to maintain these connections

4. \\(P\\) requests more peers from those neighbours

5. These peers reply with address that they know about in their ***peer databases*** (up to 1000 addresses)

6. \\(P\\) adds these given address into its ***peer database*** or update existing entries

7. Every node will also accepting *incoming* connections to serve other peers (by default 117)

#### Address Propagation Approach (Announce)

To propagate the address of new node \\(P\\)

1. The connected points \\(A\\) picks a random subset of its neighours to relay \\(P\\)'s address

2. All nodes receiving \\(P\\)'s address from \\(A\\) will do the same behaviour as \\(A\\)

3. \\(P\\)'s address will spread to the whole network (each nodes has the address in its peer database)

### Information Propagation

#### Challenges

1. How do you **find** what information other peers are sharing? (Who? Knows what?)

2. How are files **served**? (since files may be held by serveral users in distributed systems)

#### Information Propagation Approaches (Gossip)

**<span style="color:blue">Request (Traditionally but Rarely Used in Cryptocurrency Network)</span>**

Network needs a ***lookup protocol*** to identify via Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) or trackers

1. One Node \\(P\\) requests file information from a tracker \\(T\\)

2. \\(P\\) retrieves peer list in the `.torrent` files given by \\(T\\)

3. \\(P\\) connects to these peers, and then retrieve file parts

**Cons:** Some kind of centralization for ***lookup protocol***

**<span style="color:red">Announce (Commonly Follow in Cryptocurrency Network)</span>**

FIles are announced to peers (decide whether they would like a copy or not)

***No lookup protocol*** required

<span style="color:red">1. *Announce*</span>

- When receiving or generating a new artifact \\(H(tx_i)\\)

    announcer will communicate an identifer to their neighbours via an inventory message 
    
<span style="color:red">2. *Request*</span>

- When receiving the announcement of a new identifier,

    Peers who do not know the artifact will request it from the announcer
    
<span style="color:red">3. *Dliver*</span>

- When receiving the request of a known artifact,

    announcer will transmite the artifact to the requester

The announce approach usually refer as ***<span style="color:red">Gossip Protocol</span>***

**<u>Propagation Rules</u>**

- Unknown trasactions/blocks are accepted

- Known trasactions/blocks are rejected (do not care known ones)

- Accepted trasactions/blocks are validated

- Invalid trasactions/blocks are rejected

- Vaid trasactions/blocks are stored in memory

**Features**

- No lookup protocol, No central entity

- It will take ***longer*** time for an artifact spread to the entire network when the network is ***bigger***

- ***Longer propagation time*** for blocks will cause ***bigger possibilities for blockchain forks***

**Q&A**

**1. How can blocks propagte faster than transactions? (size: block >> transaction)**

- Transactions are accumlated in buffer and forwarded in batches  
  
    to break the link between first relayer and the origin of the transaction

- The propagation of blocks is not delayed to reach full network coverage as quickly as possible

**2. How can blocks propagated so fast? (size: block >> transaction)**

- <span style="color:red">There exist some fast relay networks (Falcon, FIBRE ...)</span> 

     on top of Bitcoin to enhance block propgation times

- Miners use these networks to ensure minial propagation times 
    
    always mine on top of the most recent block

### Network-Based Attacks

#### Denial-of-Service (DoS)

**<u>Aim</u>**

Make a machine or network resource ***unavailable*** to its intended users  
by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of Internet-connected host

**<u>Attacks in Bitcoin</u>**

Based on one mechanism ***Bansore Reputation System***

- Each nodes maintain a *bansore* for each neighbours

- When detecting misbehaviours of one peer, its corresponding *banscore* will be increased

    Misbehaviours have different levels which lead to different *banscore* increased

- When *banscore* reaches a threshold (100 by default)

    communication between them will be banned (for 24 hours by default)
    
*<u>Penny Flood</u>*: a large amount of small but possible transactions (each requries output)

*<u>Stress Test</u>*: the memory pool is overwhelmed (to test whether a bigger block is need or not)

#### Surveillance

**<u>Aim</u>**

Identities are not strictly tied to IP address via pseudonyms

Hence, surveillance is aimed to identify IP address of a transaction originator (privacy at risk)

**<u>Approach</u>**

Set up a supernode that can connect to all known peers (not difficult by mapping)  
based on messages in gossip network are broadcasted publicly as quickly as possible

**<u>Protection</u>** 

*<u>Diffusion</u>*: Each node forwards a new transaction only after a randomly set delay (not improve)

*<u>Dandelion</u>*: Use special transaction dissemination patterns (performance trade-off)

#### Eclipse Attacks

**<u>Aim</u>**

Partition the network by controlling the network view of another node

such that attackers can do double-spending or delay block delivery

**<u>Protection</u>** 

Use relay-network (i.e. [SABRE](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/sabre-protecting-bitcoin-against-routing-attacks/) - against Partition and DDoS)

#### Front-running Attacks

**Background**: Memory Pool & Unconfirmed Transactions

**Definition**: The ***memory pool*** which is a list of ***valid but unconfirmed transactions***

**Insert**: Transactions are copied into  the memory pool if they are valid

**Delete**: When receiving a valid block, all included transactions in this block will be deleted from the mining pool

Miners use these transactions to form blocks for mining

A block and its payload are confirmed if enough blocks have been mined on top of it  
because the chance of a fork happens there has become negligible

**<u>Dangers of Partically Confirmed Blocks</u>**

Blocks should be dropped if they end up on an orphaned fork

Therefore, nodes that accept these partically confirmed blocks  
might become targets of double-spending attacks

**<u>Dangers of Unconfirmed Transactions</u>**

Unconfirmed transactions have not even been mined and are much cheaper to create  
which can lead to many security issues (e.g., double-spending attacks, front-running attacks ...)

**Approach & Aim**

Attackers exploit the fact that they can see unconfirmed transactions before they are included in the blockchain  
such that attackers can manage to get their own transaction processed first (e.g., by offering a higher gas price)

To modify the outcome of a transaction, steal rewards, and even to influence consensus
