### Motivations & Risks

Users often wish to extend application with new functionality made available as a binary module

The code from these **<span style="color:Red">untrusted extensions</span>** will run in the **<span style="color:Red">address space of the application</span>**

If the extension code is malicous (or has bugs), there will be following risks

- Overwrite trusted data or code

- Read private data from trusted code memory

- Execute privileged instruction

- Call trusted functions with bad arguments

- Jump to middle of trusted function (e.g., jump over checks)

- Contain vulnerabilities allowing others to do above

---
### Allowed Operatoins for Untrusted Code

If the untrusted code has <span style="color:Red">its own virtual memory space</span>, some operations will still be allowed

- Read/Write/Execute its own memory

- Call explicitly allowed functions in trusted code at correct entry points

---
### Strawman Solution: Isolation with Process

Run original application (trusted) code in one process while untrusted code in another

Communicate between them by RPC between processes 

Limit untrusted operations of untrusted code in its own memory not the memory of original application

**Disadvantages**

- Not transparent for programmers

- Poor performance for users

---
### Better Solution: Software-Based Fault Isolation

#### Idea

Run untrusted extension code **<span style="color:Red">in the same process (address space)</span>** as trusted application code

Place the untrusted code and data in **<span style="color:Red">sandbox</span>** to prevent them from

- writing to trusted application memory outside sandbox, and

- transferring control to trusted application code outside sandbox

**<span style="color:Red">Add instructions before memory writes and jumps during compiling</span>**  

to inspect their targets and constrain their behavior

#### Use Scenario

Developer runs ***sandboxer*** on unsafe extension code, to produce safe, sandboxed version:

- add instructions that sandbox unsafe instructions

- transformation done by compiler (or by binary rewriter)

Before running untrusted binary code, user runs ***verifier*** on it:

- check that safe instructions not access memory outside extension code data

- check that sandboxing instructions in place before all unsafe instructions

such that the sanboxer can be complicated but <span style="color:Red">the verifier can be lightweight</span> for the checking function

and  <span style="color:Red">the user only needs to trust the verifier</span> regardless of sanboxer

---
#### Implementation in Sandboxer

**Fault Domain**

Limit untrusted code within a fault domain (still in the same address as trusted code)

- *Unique ID* 

    used for access control on syscalls

- *Code Segment*

    virtual address range with same unique high-order bits, used to hold code

- *Data segment*

    virtual address range with same unique high-order bits, used to hold data (e.g., heap, stack, static data, etc.)
    
Each segment has an unique high-order bits (e.g., high three bytes of address) for a segment

Untrusted code should only be able to (ensured by sandboxer)

- **<span style="color:Red">jump within code segment in its fault domain</span>**

- **<span style="color:Red">write within data segment in its fault domain</span>**

**Two Types of Memory Addresses in Instructions**

- *direct* (specified statically in instruction, known before runtime)

    <span style="color:Red">can be made safe statically by sandboxer during compiling</span>

- *indirect* (computed from value in register, known at runtime)

    <span style="color:Red">must be made safe by sandboxer at runtime</span>

---
**Rewrite Instruction for Indirect Memory Addresses**

For instruction `STORE R0, R1  ; write R1 to memory at value in R0`

*Normal Mode*

`MOV Ra, R0      ; copy value in R0 (current target address) into Ra`

`SHR Rb, Ra, Rc  ; store result of Ra >> Rc (current Segment ID) into Rb`

`CMP Rb, Rd      ; compare value in Rb and Rd where Rd stores the correct Segment ID`

`BNE fault       ; if not equal, cause fault`

`STORE Ra, R1    ; if equal, write R1 to memory at value in Ra`

**<span style="color:Red">Note: the last instruction should NOT be `STORE R0, R1` again</span>**

**<span style="color:Red">since adversaries can bypass previous check instructions by jumping directly to the last instruction</span>**

- add 4 instructions before each indirect store

- use 6 registers, 5 of which must be <span style="color:Red">dedicated (not available to untrusted code)</span>

    <span style="color:Red">1 register to store the Segment Mask</span> (i.e., `Rc`)
    
    <span style="color:Red">2 registers to store the correct Segment ID for Code and Date seperately</span> (i.e., `Rd`)
    
    <span style="color:Red">2 registers to store the current sandboxed (might unsafe) target address for Code and Date seperately</span> (i.e., `Ra`)

---
*Fast Mode*

**<span style="color:Red">Not checking whether the current Segment ID is correct or not but replacing the it with the correct one</span>**

`AND Ra, R0, Re  ; store result of R0 & Re into Ra to clear the current segment ID where Re is the Segment Mask`

`OR Ra, Ra, Rf   ; store result of Ra | Rf into Ra to set the correct segment ID which is stored in Rf`

`STORE Ra, R1    ; write R1 to memory at value in Ra`

**<span style="color:Red">Note: the Segment Mask will currently have *0* in high-order bits (Segment ID field) and *1* for low-order bits</span>**

- add 2 instructions before each indirect store

- use 5 dedicated registers

Similarly, 

For instruction `JR R0  ; jump to or call the memory at value in R0`

The modification is that

`AND Rg, R0, Re  ; store result of R0 & Re into Rg to clear the current segment ID where Re is the Segment Mask`

`OR Rg, Rg, Rh   ; store result of Rg | Rh into Ra to set the correct segment ID which is stored in Rh`

`JR Rg          ; jump to or call the memory at value in Rg`

<span style="color:Red">one register to store the Segment Mask is the same (i.e., `Re`)</span>

<span style="color:Red">two registers to store the correct Segment ID <br> are different for Code (i.e., `Rh`) and Data (i.e., `Rf`)</span>

<span style="color:Red">two registers to store the current sandboxed (might unsafe) target address <br> are different for Code (i.e., `Rg`) and Data (i.e., `Ra`)</span>

#### Optimizations in Sandboxer

**Guard Zones**

*Observation-1*: some instructions use **<span style="color:Red">"register + offset"</span>** addressing: 

use register as base and supply offset for CPU to add to it

which SFI should require an additional `ADD` instruction to compute the `base + offset`

*Observation-2*: **<span style="color:Red">offsets are of limited size</span>** (\\( \pm \\)65,536 on MIPS) because of instruction encoding

such that SFI can **<span style="color:Red">surround each segment with 0xfffff (0 ~ 65535) guard zone which are unmapped pages</span>**

and access the guard zone (unmapped pages) will cause traps

Therefore, the offsets can be ignored when sandboxing  
to save the additional `ADD` instruction to compute the `base + offset`

**Stack Pointer**

*Observation*: **<span style="color:Red">stack pointer is read far more often than written</span>** 

since it is often used as base address for many "register + offset" instructions

such that SFI will **<span style="color:Red">not sandbox uses (read) of stack pointer as base address</span>**

but will **<span style="color:Red">sandbox setting (write) of stack pointer</span>** such that **<span style="color:Red">stack pointer always contains safe value</span>**

Therefore, it will reduce number of instructions that pay sandboxing overhead

---
#### Implementations of Verifier

After receiving sandboxed code, verifier must ensure all instructions safe

- For direct memory addressing, check statically that Segment IDs in addresses are correct

- For indirect memory addressing, check instructions should be preceded by full set of sandboxing instructions

- Check there is no privileged instructions in code (e.g., system calls in the untrusted code)

- Check the target PC-relative branches should fall in code segment

If sandboxed code fails any of these checks, verifier rejects it; otherwise, code is correctly sandboxed

---
#### Limitations of SFI in MIPS

**Variable-Length Instructions in x86**

MIPS instructions are fixed-length while x86 instructions are **<span style="color:Red">variable-length</span>**

which will cause that attackers in x86 can **<span style="color:Red">jump into middle of x86 instructions</span>**

e.g., 

when attackers jump into the second bytes of `25 CD 80 00 00` (`AND eax, 0x80CD`), 

it will execute `CD 80` which is `int 0x80` ----- a system call on Linux

such that **<span style="color:Red">jump into middle of x86 instructions could also jump out of fault domain into application trusted code</span>**

**Fewer Registers in x86-32**

There are only 4 general-purpose registers in x86 which **<span style="color:Red">cannot dedicate registers easily</span>** (not a problem in x86-64)

---
#### Effectiveness

**Stack Smash**

The sandboxer will only allow jump within Code segment in its fault domain

and the injected code is stored on the stack within Data segment

such that <span style="color:Red">stack smash attacks cannot be executed</span>

**return-to-libc**

Attackers can overwrite return address (through buffer overflow) with one address within Code segment in fault domain 

such that <span style="color:Red">return-to-libc attacks can be executed within the untrusted extension</span>

**string format vulnerability**

Attackers can overwrite return address (through `%n` overwritten) with one address within Code segment in fault domain 

such that <span style="color:Red">string format vulnerability attacks can be executed within the untrusted extension</span>

**Conclusion**

Because

- SFI allows write any data into data segment of extension

- SFI allows jump into any address in code segment of extension

such that attacker can exploit in extension (<span style="color:Red">not designed for exploit but for untrusted code isolation</span>)

and can probably cause jump out of fault domain on x86 (<span style="color:Red">not designed for x86 but for MIPS</span>)
