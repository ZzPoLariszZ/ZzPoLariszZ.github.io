### NFS and Ivy Review

**NFS**

- Share one filesystem among clients

- Explicit communication (RPC)

- Caching

- Weak Consistency

**Ivy**

- Share virtual memory among CPUs

- Implicit communication

- Read-only sharing

- Strong Consistency

### Failure and Atomicity

When two servers must take an action in a distributed system,

- when action succeeds, both should do the action in correct order

- when action fails, neither should do the action (***avoid one side to act***)

#### Two Kinds of Atomicity

**Serializability**

Outside observer sees series of operations requested by users 

that each complete atomically in some complete order

<span style="color:Red">Solution: Locking and Unlocking</span>

**Recoverability**

Each operation executes completely or not at all ("all-or-nothing semantics")

such that no partial results exist

<span style="color:Red">Solution: Two-Phase Commit</span>

---
### Components

- Client

- Transaction Coordinator (TC)

- Server A

- Server B

---
### Strawman Atomic Commit (Wrong)

#### Process

<img src="/assets/images/COMP0133/LEC-06/strawman.png" width="300" />

1. Client ---start---> TC

2. TC ---debit---> Server A

3. TC ---credit---> Server B

4. TC ---ok---> Client

#### Disagreement when Failure

*Server A not commit but Server B commit*, e.g., 
    
- Not enough money in account of Bank A (Transfer Scenario)
    
- Server A crash or Network to A down
    
*Server A commit but Server B not commit*, e.g., 
    
- No existed account of Bank B (Transfer Scenario)
    
- Server B crash or Network to B down
    
- TC crash between sending to A and sending to B

---
### Properties of Atomic Commit

**Safety**

- If one commit, no one abort

- If one abort, no one commit

**Liveness**

- If transaction succeed, A and B commit, finally commit

- If transaction fail, the system should come to some conclusion ASAP

***<span style="color:Red">Commonly, safety should be more important than liveness</span>***

### Correct Atomic Commit (Safety)

#### Process

<img src="/assets/images/COMP0133/LEC-06/correct.png" width="300" />

**Phase 1: Prepare**

1. Client ---start---> TC

2. TC ---prepare---> Server A

3. TC ---prepare---> Server B

4. Server A ---Yes/No---> TC

5. Server B ---Yes/No---> TC

**Phase 2-1: Commit**

If both Server A and B send "Yes" to TC, come to *commit* phase

1. TC ---commit---> Server A

2. TC ---commit---> Server B

3. TC ---ok---> Client

**Phase 2-2: Abort**

If one of Server A and B send "No" to TC, come to *abort* phase

1. TC ---abort---> Server A

2. TC ---abort---> Server B

---
#### <span style="color:Red">Safety (Yes)</span>

TC is centralized such that it can know decisions of both Server A and B (enforced agreement)

---
#### <span style="color:Red">Liveness (No)</span>

***Timeout***

- **TC wait for "Yes/No" from Server A and B**

    TC is <span style="color:Red">conservative</span> (Safety >>> Liveness)  
    such that it will abort when message is lost or come late (set a time for timeout)

- **Server A and B wait for "Commit/Abort" from TC**

    Assume Server B is waiting (Server A is the same)
    
    when Server B vote "No", Server B can simply think TC will abort
    
    when Server B vote "Yes", Server B should wait forever for TC  
    (cannot decide to abort or commit since Server A can vote "Yes" or "No")
    
    *<span style="color:Red">Termination Protocol as a Mitigation when Server B Vote "Yes"</span>*

    Server B will sent ***status*** request to Server A what Server A vote for

    - No reply from Server A: Server B wait forever for TC

    - Server A receive "Commit/Abort" from TC: Server B make the same decision
    
    - Server A has not voted "Yes" or "No": Both Server A and B abort (TC cannot commit before receiving from A)
    
    - Server A vote "No": Both Server A and B abort
    
    - Server A vote "Yes": Server B wait forever for TC (TC can commit but can also abort when TC timeout)
    
***Crash-and-Reboot***

The "commit" decision should not be back after it has been decided

- **TC crash after deciding and sending "Commit" to Server A and B**

- **Server A and B crash after deciding and sending "Yes" to TC**

*<span style="color:Red">Persistent State as a Solution when Crash and Reboot</span>*

such that all nodes should know their state before crash (using non-volatile memory)

<span style="color:Red">Order: Write then Send</span>

- When TC find that no "Commit" is on disk after reboot, it will abort

- When TC find that "Commit" is on disk after reboot, it will commit

- When Server A and B find that no "Yes" is on disk after reboot, it will abort

- When Server A and B find that "Yes" is on disk after reboot, it will use *Terminiation Protocol*

---
#### Conclusion

**Safety**

- All hosts that decide reach same decision because of the ***centralized TC***

- No "Commit" from TC unless every server vote “Yes”

**Liveness**

- If no failures and every server vote “Yes”, then commit

- if failures, then repair, ***wait long enough***, eventually some decision

---
### Theorem

***<span style="color:Red">No distributed asynchronous protocol can correctly agree (provide both safety and liveness) <br> in presence of crash-failures (i.e., if failures not repaired)</span>***
