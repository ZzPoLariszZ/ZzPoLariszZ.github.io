UCL Course COMP0133 LEC-19: OKWS and Least Privilege

<!--more-->

---
### Motivation and Goal

**Situation**

- Servers often hold sensitive data and Single server shared by different users

- One user should not see data of other users

- Subsystems on single server must cooperate to operate

**Goal**

<span style="color:Red">Prevent users from obtaining or modifying data other than their own</span>

<span style="color:Red">to limit the harm that attackers can do when exploiting the server</span>

---
### Approach: Compartmentalization

Provide <span style="color:Red">minimal access to system data and resources for its job</span> for each subsystem

Define <span style="color:Red">narrow interfaces that allow only exact operatons required for applications</span> between subsystems

Define assuming <span style="color:Red">exploit may occur, especially in subsystems closest to users</span>

---
### Idea

#### Principle of Least Privilege

- Each subsystem should only have access to read or modify data needed for its job

- The above requirement should be enforced externally (OS -> APP) not within subsystems

- Must decompose system into subsystems  
    必须将系统分解为子系统

    Must reason carefully about truly minimal set of privileges needed by each subsystem  
    必须仔细推理每个子系统所需的真正最小权限集
    
- Must be able to grant privileges in fine-grained (not generous) manner  
    必须能够以细粒度的方式授予权限

#### Privilege Separation

- Determine which subsystems most exposed to attack

- Reduce privileges of most exposed subsystems

---
### Implementations

#### Follow Least Privilege Principle and Privilege Separation

- <span style="color:Red">split a web server into multiple processes</span>

- <span style="color:Red">each process has different minimal privileges and runs as different user IDs</span>

- <span style="color:Red">use UNIX isolation mechanism to prevent processes from reading or writing data of others</span>

#### UNIX Isolation Mechanism

**Change Root Directory**

**<span style="color:Red">The system call `chroot()` which changes the root directory of the calling process to that specified in path</span>**

which means it can set process's notion of file system root such that directories above this point will not be changed

e.g.,

`chdir("/usr/local/alone");` ----- change the current working directory of the calling process to the given directory

`chroot("/usr/local/alone");` ----- change the root directory of the calling process to the given directory

`setuid(61100);` ----- set the effective user ID (currently unprivileged user ID that not be used) of the calling process

such that **<span style="color:Red">process has no access to any other filesystem except files in tree rooted at specific path `/usr/local/alone`</span>** ----- *Pros*

then it is impossible to access UNIX setuid-root programs (e.g., change password) or other sensitive data elsewhere on disk

but it is needed to <span style="color:Red">have a priori set up all system files needed by process in directory</span> ----- *Cons*

**Pass File Descriptor**

Since the parent server process is privileged (as root) initially,

the privileged <span style="color:Red">parent process can open files that needed by unprivileged child</span>

and <span style="color:Red">can pass the child *open file descriptors* to these files when the parent `fork()` child</span>

such that child process can read these files even if it cannot open them

and **<span style="color:Red">can pass the child *open file descriptors* to these files dynamically by `sendmsg()` after the parent `fork()` child</span>**

such that child process that connect to network can just accept connection (not read) 

and then pass socket for that connection to another lower privileged process that can read

**<span style="color:Red">It is needed since the privileged parent server process not have connection to network to get the potential malicious user inputs</span>**

#### Overview

<img src="/assets/images/COMP0133/LEC-19/okws.png" width="300" />

- *okld* (launcher daemon) process forks *okd* (dispatcher) process, *oklogd* (logger daemon) process, and a series of service processes

    where <span style="color:Red">*okld* process is privileged (as root)</span>
    
    <span style="color:Red">services request to *oklogd* process by RPC to write log entries to disk (only *oklogd* process has the write privilege)</span>
    
    and <span style="color:Red">external network requests are received by *okd* process</span>

- *okd* process forks *pubd* (publish daemon) process

    where *pubd* process has limited read access to static data (e.g., configuration files and HTML template files) stored on the local disk
    
- <span style="color:Red">*okd* process parses user input without holding any sensitive data</span>

    and send user input to corresponding service processess by RPC
    
- <span style="color:Red">each service process (i.e., $svc_i$) parses the received user input in a jail directory `chroot()`ed by *okld* process</span>

    such that each of them cannot read or write data in other services

- <span style="color:Red">database proxy process (i.e., $data_i$) only accpets authenticated requests for subset of narrow RPC interface</span>

    which can then read sensitive data from database

---
### Effectiveness

**<span style="color:Red">Althrough *okld* process runs as root, there is no need to worry about exploit on it</span>**

**<span style="color:Red">since it has no potentially malicious user input, and *okd* child process with lower privilege will accept them</span>**

---
### Trade-off between Isolation and Performance

<img src="/assets/images/COMP0133/LEC-19/tradeoff.png" width="400" />

where

- $s_i$ ----- services

- $u_j$ ----- users

- $t_{i,j}$ ----- state for user $u_j$ in service $s_i$

- $p_k$ ----- processes

- $\rightarrow$ ----- dependency (e.g., process $p_1$ depends on service $s_1$ in OKWS Model)

- Grey Shading ----- entities that will be influenced by attackers when process $p_1$ is exploited successfully

#### Strict Model

Strict Model uses ***one process per user*** which will give the strictest isolation

**<span style="color:Red">but it will require many processes which will lead to high cost and low performance</span>**

e.g., huge memory cost due to seperate virtual memory space & huge CPU cost due to context switch (change one process to another) 

#### OKWS Model

OKWS Model uses ***one process per service*** which will achieve lower cost and better performance

**<span style="color:Red">but the compromised service may reveal data of one user to another</span>**

---
### Summary

- Least Privilege Principle and Privilege Separation **hold real promise for limiting harm exploits can do**

- Programming model for services **<span style="color:Red">requires new style of programming</span>**

    - must set up all system files needed by process in directory since `chroot()`ed services

    - must define narrow and per-service interfaces to database

    - must communicate explicitly using RPC between service and database
