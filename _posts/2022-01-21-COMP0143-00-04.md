### Scenario: Sealed-Bid Auctions

**Process**

- *Bidding Stage*: Bidders submit their sealed bids.

- *Opening Stage*: All bids are opened and the highest one wins.

**Protection against Cheating**

- *Bidding Stage*: A sealed bid \\(c_i\\) should not leak any information about the bid \\(b_i\\).

- *Opening Stage*: A bidder should not be able to open its bid to another one \\(b^\prime_i \neq b_i\\).

### Definition 

Commitment Scheme is an interactive protocol between a sender \\(S\\) and a receiver \\(R\\).

#### Components

- **Commit**

	Sender \\(S\\) sends a commitment \\(c := \text{Commit}(m,r)\\) to receiver \\(R\\)

	where \\(m\\) is the message and \\(r\\) is a randomness

- **Reveal**

	Sender \\(S\\) reveals \\(c\\) by sending \\(m\\) and \\(r\\) to receiver \\(R\\)

	who accepts if \\(c =  \text{Commit}(m,r)\\)


#### Security Goal

- **Hiding**

	Receiver \\(R\\) should not be able to obtain any information about \\(m\\) from \\(c\\)

- **Binding**

	Sender \\(S\\) should not be able to reveal \\(c\\) to any other message \\(m^\prime \neq m\\)


#### Adversary Types

- **Hiding-Adversary \\(\mathcal{A}\\)** (role as Receiver \\(R\\))

    who aims to learn information about \\(m\\) from \\(c := \text{Commit}(m,r)\\) 

- **Binding-Adversary \\(\mathcal{A}\\)** (role as Sender \\(S\\))

    who aims to find \\((m, r)\\) and \\((m^\prime, r^\prime)\\) that meets \\(\text{Commit}(m,r) = \text{Commit}(m^\prime,r^\prime) \quad \text{where} \quad m \neq m^\prime\\)
