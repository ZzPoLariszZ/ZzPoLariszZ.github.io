### Byzantine Adversaries

#### Goal

Prevent network systems from achieving their objects

#### Capabilities

- Corrupt a subset of \\(f\\) out of \\(n\\) nodes (where \\(f \leq n\\))

    Adversaries have access to all secrets of nodes in \\(f\\)
    
    Adversaries control their actions of nodes in \\(f\\)

- Take actions arbitrarily

    e.g., returning any values at all, sending messages in any order, transmitting corrupt values ...

- Observe all messages from honest nodes before taking actions

    Adversaries who take action last called ***rushing***

#### Relaxtional Variety: Rational Adversaries

**Definition**

Adversaries will act in a ***utility-maximizing*** way

i.e they exploit system weakness to maximize profits ***without*** causing the system dysfunctional

---
### Consensus

#### Goal

Protect Distributed Systems

#### Properties

- ***Safety***

    Honest nodes have a consistent view of system's state
    
    which agree which transactions took place in what order

- ***Liveness***

    Honest nodes can make progress and update system's state eventually 

- ***Fairness***

    Nodes are awarded according to their contributions
    
    This is specific to incentive-driven systems (relevant against rational adversaries)
    
**Note that**

The security requirements are based on

$$
|n|=2|f|+1 \quad (<50\% \text{ corrupt nodes})
$$

$$
|n|=3|f|+1 \quad (<33\% \text{ corrupt nodes})
$$

which make ***<span style="color:Red">Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT)</span>*** consensus meaningful

#### Requirement: Sybil-Resistant

Sybil Attacks is to create a large number of presudonyms (called *sockpuppets*)

to subvert the reputation system of a networked service (the root cause for many security issues)

**Note that**

The ***cheaper*** it is to create a pesudonym in a networked system

The ***easier*** it usually becomes to mount Sybil Attacks

The secuirty requirements to create ***Sybil-Resistant Identities***

### Bitcoin Solution: Proof-of-Work

***<span style="color:Red">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</span>***: Solving computational puzzles

#### Process

Given the length of blockchain \\(l\\)

1. Gather transactions from the network into a block \\(B_l\\)

2. Brute-force search a nonce in the block header of \\(B_l\\) until

    $$
    H(B_l) < t
    $$
    
    where \\(H\\) is a ***Collision-Resistant Hash Function (CRHF)***  
    and \\(t\\) is a ***target value*** which represnets the difficulty of computational puzzles
    
3. Once found, broadcast \\(B_l\\) with the specfic nonce as ***Proof-of-Work*** to the rest of network

**Note that**

A block is accepted only if its ***Proof-of-Work*** and ***all included transactions*** are valid

#### Properties

- Permissionless

- Independence

- Optimization-free

- Progress-free

- Parameterizability

- Easy-to-verify

- Hardness-Accimulation

#### Requirement: Puzzle-Friendly

**Definition**

A Collision-Resistant Hash Function \\(H\\) is ***puzzle-friendly*** when

for every possible \\(n\\)-bit output value \\(t\\), and  
for every random valye \\(k\\) chosen from a distribution with high min-entropy:  
it is ***infeasible*** to find \\(x\\) such that \\(t=H(k||x)\\) in time significantly less thatn \\(2^n\\)

In other words,

players cannot find a better way to hit the target value \\(t\\) than trying random inputs \\(x\\)

**Note that**

Bitcoin uses \\(H(\cdot) := \text{SHA-256}(\text{SHA-256}(\cdot))\\) as a ***puzzle-friendly CRHF***

In Bitcoin, the *target* \\(t\\) is the upper bound for which Proof-of-Works are considered valid.

The *target* \\(t\\) is based on *difficulty* \\(d\\) which meets

$$
t = \frac{2^{256}}{2^{32} \cdot d}-1
$$

means that the easiest possible *target* \\(t_{max} = 2^{224}-1\\) (system parameter) is when \\(d = 2^0 = 1\\)

#### Challenge: Blockchain Forks


Since Proof-of-Work is a probabilistic process, 

it is possible that different nodes broadcast their found blocks at the same time

**Type**

- Unintended Forks (probabilistic process)

- Intended Forks (essential tool to upgrade blockchain)

#### Solution: Longest Chain Rule

The solution to unintended forks used in Bitcoin is ***<span style="color:Red">Longest Chain Rule</span>***

**Process**

- Miners randomly picks one of the longest branches they are aware of to work on

- Every time there is a new longest chain,  

    all honest miners switch to this branch orphaning shorter ones

- Probability that a fork survives drops of exponentially with each new mined block

- ***Eventual Consistency***

    To consider a block finalized, it is recommended to wait until several blocks have been mined on top of it  
    
    In Bitcoin, 6 blocks (about 60 min) is recommended
  
**Note:**

Longest Chain Rule means that anyone controls > 50% hashing power will control the Bitcoin

hashing power is as a *proxy* to security requirements since the size of \\(n\\) and \\(f\\) is unknown

In Bitcoin, the required hashing power to mine a block in \\(b\\) second is

$$
p = \frac{2^{32} \cdot d}{b}
$$

#### Putting Everything Together: Nakamoto Consensus

**Process**

Given the length of blockchain \\(l\\)

1. Gather transactions from the network into a block \\(B_l\\)  
   
   ***<span style="color:Red">including a hash pointer to a randonly-chosen longest chain</span>***

2. Brute-force search a nonce in the block header of \\(B_l\\) until

    $$
    H(B_l) < t
    $$
    
    where \\(H\\) is a ***<span style="color:Red">Puzzle-Friendly CRyptographic Hash Function (CRHF)</span>***  
    and \\(t\\)is a ***target value*** which represnets the difficulty of computational puzzles
    
3. Once found, broadcast \\(B_l\\) with the specfic nonce as ***Proof-of-Work*** to the rest of network

#### Attack: 51% of Hashing Power

If someone has 51% of hashing power (centraliztion), he/she can take over this cryptocurrency

- Undermining ***Convergence***: Fork the chain and double spend


- Undermining ***Fairness***: Reject blocks of all other miners


- Undermining ***Liveness***: Demand high transaction fees + Censor Transactions

**However, 51% Attacks are not common in practice**

- All attacks are highly visible (broadcast)

- Risk that currency loses value

- Mining hardware is illiquid: high entry costs and no salvage value

#### Attack: Selfish Mining 

- If you get lucky and and find a block then withhold it, 

    which means that you do not tell everyone immediately about it to engage in selfish mining

- If you can mine new blocks fast enough on top of yours, 

    then honest miners waste their hash power extending the shorter chain

### Proof-of-Work Mining Evolution

#### Energy Requirements

***<span style="color:Red">Cheap Eletricity & Good Network & Cool Climate</span>***

- **Embodied Energy**

    For manufacturing of chips and other hardware

- **Electricity**

    For the actual operation of the mining devices
    
- **Cooling Energy**

    For the protection of the mining equipment

#### Mining Pool

**Definition**

Pool participants all attempt to mine a block with the same coinbase recipient  
    
which in practice is usually a key owned by the pool manager

**Distribute Revenue**

which can be based on 

- Per Share
    
    how much PoW shares they contribute minus a cut for the pool manager
    
- Proportional  
    
    since last block (Lower risk for pool manager + More work to verify)
    
- Per Last \\(n\\) Shares
    
    Minimize *"Pool hopping"*  

- "Pool-hopping"

    The practice of mining in a pool only during the good times, and leaving during the bad times  

    Can get more out of the pool than the value they contribute to it,  
    increasing their rewards at the expense of other miners

    which is common in Proportional Distribution Method

**Features**

- *Advantages*: Make mining revenue more predictable and enable smaller miners to still contribute

- *Disadvantages*: Lead to centralization.

### Proof-of-X: Variants and Alternatives

#### Ethereum 2.0 Solution: Proof-of-Stake

**Idea** 

Prove your investment in the system to gain voting power and be allowed to participate in consensus

**Challenge**

- *Nothing-at-Stake*: Work on all available forks to ensure/maximize profits (consistency issue)

- *Grinding*: Exploit the fact that blocks are cheap to produce to influence consensus (fairness issue)

- ***<span style="color:Red">Long-Range Attacks</span>***

    Bribe stakers for their old keys to roll back many blocks and create valid forks (consistency and safety issues).

---
### Upgrading Decentralized Systems

#### Situation

- Everyone agrees to use a new signature scheme for **OP_CHECKSIG**

- Flag Day

    Everyone agrees that at a given block height
    
    all transactions before are valid using old OP_CHECKSIG
    
    all transactions after must use the new OP_CHECKSIG

#### Different Situation 1: Hard Forks

Some miners do not upgrade in time called ***<span style="color:Red">Hard Forks</span>*** 

because block produced before and after adoption of the decision are incompatible with each other

**Think Deeply**

Some full nodes do not upgrade in time

- Full nodes are absolutely essential to the security of the system 

    but cannot be trusted to all update in sync
    
- Full nodes that do not change over to the main chain can be vulnerable to attacks 
    
    and form a split currency which threatens economic stability
    
**Real World Example**

- *Bitcoin Cash*

- *Ethereum Classic*

- *Monero*

#### Different Situation 2: Soft Forks

Some people agree to change the block size to 0.5 MB

can be one specific case of ***<span style="color:Red">Soft Forks</span>*** 

**Problems in Backwords Compatibility**

- People who have changed into smaller block size will reject blocks with old rules

- People who have not changed will accept blocks from the changed people

**Still form a split currency which threatens economic stability**

#### Governance

Two important layers in cryptocurrency communities

- ***Infrastructure***

    Decentralized payment system based on global peer-to-peer network
    
- ***Developers***

    Small groups of software engineers 
    
    who have been entrusted with key roles for the development of the technology

Not clear who gets to vote and makes decisions
